### Consideration
### About the tool versions
- Version 7.2.0 of Appium is being used since the last one is not compatible with MobileElement, which is necessary since if we use the latest version a major refactoring would be needed in the project.
- Version 3.141.59 of Selenium is being used since the last one is not compatible with the implemented Appium version.
- Version 6.14.3 of TestNG was selected since the last one is not compatible with Java 8.
